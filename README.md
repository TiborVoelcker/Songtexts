# Songtexts
A small app that shows the lyrics for the current song playing on your spotify. Just a project for learning purposes.

---

It pulls the currently playing song from the Spotify api (which first needs to be set up) and then searches for the lyrics from Musixmatch api (which also needs to be set up first). Using PyQt5 for the GUI and handwritten a OAuth package.

### Main takeaways
- how OAuth works
- working with APIs
- that a good source of lyrics is hard to find
- store keys in a seperate file
